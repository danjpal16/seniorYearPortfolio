                <ul>
                    <li>Hi, I’m Daniel Palagano</li>
                    <li>I joined the Web Design Program in my sophomore year because I’ve always been drawn to computer
                        science</li>
                    <li>That year was tough, I struggled a lot and even thought about quitting</li>
                    <li>But instead, I stuck with it, asked Mr. Kilgore tons of questions, and kept pushing</li>
                    <li>My projects didn’t always look the best, but they worked, and I had fun making them</li>
                    <li>Beyond web design, I’m passionate about all things computers</li>
                    <li>I’m heading to Virginia Tech to major in Cybersecurity</li>
                    <li>There, I plan to work hard, land great internships, and aim for the top of my class</li>
                    <li>After college, I hope to land a cybersecurity role with a government agency like the NSA, FBI,
                        CIA, or Homeland Security</li>
                </ul>
